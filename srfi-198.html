<h2>Status</h2>


<h2>Abstract</h2>

When errors from Scheme interfaces to "foreign" systems such as the
P<small>OSIX</small> API, libraries, and databases are detected, this
SRFI provides the means to construct, return or signal, and extract
information from those errors in a reasonably uniform way.


<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>


<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>R6RS and R7RS-large have ambitions to become comprehensive
ecosystems useful for developing real world applications.  This
necessitates the development of many interfaces to "foreign" systems,
ranging from direct Foreign Function Interfaces (FFIs) to low level
assembler and C libraries, including APIs at that level such as
P<small>OSIX</small>, to protocols such as TCP/IP, all the way to
client-server systems such as databases running in their own
processes.</p>

<p>This SRFI provides a comprehensive framework for placing data about
errors from foreign systems into an object, starting with
<em>error-sets</em> to partition collections of related errors,
such as 'posix, 'postgresql, and 'libsodium, and to report them.</p>

<p>Sometimes it will make sense to simply return an error object, but
an often preferred method is to raise an exception, like
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-170/srfi-170.html">SRFI
170</a> in which procedures never return error codes, or use an
analogue of the P<small>OSIX</small> <code>errno</code> variable to
indicate system-call-level errors.</p>

<p>Thus procedures can return useful values, and the programmer can to
assume that if a foreign interface procedure returns, it succeeded.
This greatly simplifies the flow of the code from the programmer's
point of view.</p>


<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Under construction.</p>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

A sample work in progress implementation of this SRFI can be found in
the srfi directory of its repository.


<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

Thanks to Olin Shivers and all the Scheme implementers who have
followed his work; this SRFI was inspired by scsh's
<code>errno-error</code> facility.  Thanks also to all the
participants in the SRFI 170 and SRFI 198 mailing lists.
