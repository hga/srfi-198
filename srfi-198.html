<h2>Status</h2>

??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history.
The editor will add this section.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

??? abstract, preferably shorter than 200 words.  Please outline the
need for, and design of, the proposal.

<h2>Issues</h2>

??? Optional section that may point out things to be resolved.  This
will not appear in the final SRFI.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

??? detailed rationale.  This should be 200-500 words long.  Please
explain why the proposal should be incorporated as a standard feature
in Scheme implementations.  List related standards and SRFIs,
including dependencies, conflicts, and replacements.  If there are
other standards which this proposal will replace or with which it will
compete, please explain why the present proposal is a substantial
improvement.

<h2>Specification</h2>

??? detailed specification.  This should be detailed enough that a
conforming implementation could be completely created from this
description.

<h2>Implementation</h2>

??? explanation of how it meets the sample implementation
requirement (see <a href="srfi-process.html">process</a>), and the
code, if possible, or a link to it

<a href="srfi minus ???-sample.scm">Source for the sample implementation.</a>
